          <h2 id="headline">Story of Naruto's Life :</h2>
          <article>
            <h3>1. Early Life</h3>
            <p>Naruto was born on the night of October 10th to Minato Namikaze (the Fourth Hokage) and Kushina Uzumaki (the second jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails). He was named after Naruto Musasabi, the protagonist of Jiraiya's first book, which made the Sannin his godfather.</p>
            <h3>2. Living as a jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails</h3>
            <p>Minato's dying wish that Naruto be regarded as a hero was honoured by the very few who could put aside their pain and losses caused by the disaster, while the majority of Konoha, however having no knowledge of the circumstances surrounding his birth, openly ostracised and resented Naruto for containing the beast that devastated the village and took many lives; some even viewed Naruto as the Nine-Tails itself. Soon, the Third Hokage forbade anyone from mentioning the Nine-Tails, hoping that the younger generation would not blindly hate Naruto as their parents did.</p>
            <h3>3. Member of Team 7</h3>
            <p>Team 7 was a Konohagakure team formed under the leadership of Kakashi Hatake. Two-and-a-half years after Sasuke Uchiha left the village, Kakashi filled out paperwork to form Team Kakashi, with his former pupils Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno now being treated as equals alongside their teacher. Following Yamato and Sai joining the team, the group went by Team Yamato during the former's leadership.</p>
